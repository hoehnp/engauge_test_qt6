# Run this on mark-HP-Notebook in Kubuntu 18.04 (64 bit)
#
# Assumes prerequisites are already installed:
# 1) Starting at https://flatpak.org/setup and picking Kubuntu (versus Ubuntu) leads
#    to steps installing with plasma instead of gnome.
#    Be sure to add the flathub repository
# 2) Then installing SDK according to http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/first-build.html.
#    This step will fail if the flathub repository was not added in the previous step.

#      org.freedesktop.Sdk.Locale
#      org.freedesktop.Platform.html5-codecs
#      org.freedesktop.Platform.VAAPI.Intel
# 3) sudo apt install flatpak-builder
# 4) Install engauge-specific github repo
#      cd $HOME
#      git clone git@github.com:flathub/io.github.markummitchell.Engauge_Digitizegit
# 5) Running this script gives error about org.kde.Sdk/x86_64/5.11 not installed so
#      flatpak install flathub org.kde.Sdk
#    and pick the version option matching the error message
# 6) Running this script gives error about org.kde.Platform/x86_64/5.11 not installed so
#      flatpak install flathub org.kde.Platform
#    and pick the version option matching the error message
# 7) Got error:
#      Remote listing engauge-digitizer not available; server has no summary file.
#      Check the URL passed to remote-add was valid
#      error: app/io.github.markummitchell.Engauge_Digitizer/x86_64/master not installed
#    fix: flatpak remote-add --user --no-gpg-verify engauge-digitizer \
#         file:///home/mark/io.github.markummitchell.Engauge_Digitizer/repo
# 8) Issue 311 'Flatpak is missing default filename on Save' occurs on at least Mint/Cinnamon,
#    with SaveAs file default file and file extension not set. Fix requires multiple steps to
#    environment (outside of Engauge):
#      + sudo apt install plasma-discover-flatpak-backend     (one time step)
#      + sudo apt install xdg-desktop-portal-kde              (one time step)
#      + find /usr -name xdg-desktop-portal                   (find xdg-desktop-portal executable)
#      + find /usr -name xdg-desktop-portal-kde               (find xdg-desktop-portal-kde executable)
#      + kill xdg-desktop-portal
#      + kill xdg-desktop-portal-kde
#      + export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=KDE
#      + /usr/.../xdg-desktop-portal-kde &
#      + /usr/.../xdg-desktop-portal &                        (this connects later flatpak apps to KDE)
#      + flatpak run io.github.markummitchell.Engauge_Digitizer
# 9) Got error 'Note that the directories .. are  not in the search path set by XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable'
#    fix: edit ~/.bashrc and do 'export XDG_DATA_DIRS=..:$XDG_DATA_DIRS' where .. are the missing directories
