<H2>How are timezones handled?</H2>
<P>The system timezone is used when computing time values, which are sometimes
  used for one of the two coordinates. In most cases this strategy gives
  consistent time values from one execution to the next, but inconsistency
  may appear when (1) the system timezone is changed on the computer
  running Engauge, or (2) a document is used on another computer with
  a different timezone.</P>
<H2>How to fix the timezone?</H2>
<P>If time values are incorrect due to a timezone change, there are
  at least two solutions:
  <OL>
    <LI><B>TZ environment variable</B> can be set with a value like 'America/Los_Angeles'. This
    fix only affects the shell where the TZ variable is set.</LI>
    <LI><B>System timezonoe</B> can be changed using an operating system interface. This fix
    affects all applications.</LI>
  </OL>
  Instruction for implementing either solution on your computer may be found on the internet.</P>
